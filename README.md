# Roll-A-Ball
First game I made in unity
W, A, S, D keys control motion
Mouse controls where you Look
Space bar jumps
pickups are super speed (rocket icon) and super jump (Spring with ball icon)
SUper speed can be activated by pressing shift, super jump can be activated by pressing Q
Other collectables are red rubys and coins 
coins give you a point value added to your score
Rubys are able to be turned in and allow access to new areas
Holding down left click fires your weapons
